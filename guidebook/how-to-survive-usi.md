## Bachelor Project

Start from mid 5th semester to look for the professors of USI that aligns to
your interests. 
You can find their interests in 
[USI page](https://search.usi.ch/en/faculties/3/faculty-of-informatics/people)
and their corresponding research team topics.
Go by exclusion if you do not know what you like.
Ask gently such professors whether they have some bachelor project proposal 
or propose yourself some project that might interest them.

Remember: do not wait until start 6th semester to ask professors for a project,
many of them will already be selected.

## SA5 Field Project

All courses of 1st year and SA3 are prerequisite to do SA5.
SA5 is a core course of the BSc i.e. is mandatory to do it to graduate.
The course consists in an internship in a Swiss company during the 5th semester.
Some internships may evolve in job positions: do it well! 

**Tips**: althought exemption is an option, 
our economic system promotes switching jobs frequently.
SA5 will give you the opportunity to have (another) working experience 
in Switzerland and getting an high grade to increase your GPA. 

## SA4 Software Engineering Project

Grade of the overall course is heavily given by the project.

Choose wisely team leaders: 
balanced strong people with both social and technical skills.
The order of skills is not casual.

## SA3 Web Atelier

Weed-out course[^1].

The project will be harsh and **very** time consuming.

Please do it at the start of each week, 
otherwise you won't be able to keep the pace.

A key to pass the project is to check what the tests evaluate:
even though the functionality is there, the tests may check smaller details,
be sure to satisfy them all.

Develop strong debugging skills by using powerful IDEs: 
conditional breakpoints, stacktrace analysis.

Suggestions: Jetbrains IDE Webstorm.

## Algorithms and Systems programming

Weed-out course[^1].

Training in Leetcode and Codeforces in C++ can save you from these hard courses.

All resources are useful to pass this course.

Develop strong debugging skills by using powerful IDEs: 
conditional breakpoints, stacktrace analysis.

Suggestions: Jetbrains IDEs Pycharm for Python, Clion for C++.

Good luck!
