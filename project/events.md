University administration has many contacts regarding communication of events and third parties to join e.g. food trucks.

Student organization is highly recommended to contact to leverage communication and gather students.

In the form the university administration will give to Lugano city, 
write the expected number of people in agreement with student organizations if involved. 

## Guidelines

The square park within the Est Campus is a public space managed by Lugano City and shared between USI and SUPSI.
In order to do any kind of event there, 
- compile a form for the Lugano City authorities i.e. muncipality and police. At least 2 weeks before.
- ask USI/SUPSI administrative offices. They handle primary expenses i.e. electricity, cleaning, security.

To be guided during this process, please contact [University Administration](#contacts).
They will handle most of the people to contact.

## Restrictions

### Food Events

For food related events, in April 2024 it is still not possible to organize an alternative to the canteen handled by SV GROUP.
Mensa has a contract with USI to not have unfair competition within USI campus.
Any food events must wait the mensa to close in order to be able to start.

### Costs

The university does not compensate any third party cost for a student event to happen.
E.g. USI won't pay what canteen expects to earn in a day, 
if for that same day you want to organize a food event during canteen active hours.

## Roadmap
