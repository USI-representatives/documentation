# Faculty Rules Proposals

## Project

Increase speed of projects through reforms of faculty rules.

## Roadmap

### Academic year

#### 2023/2024

**At least 1 representative from Bachelor's degree and 1 for Master's degree**

The rationale about it is straightforward to formulate:
different degrees with different students will have different kind of problems 
and specialized representatives.

Make such rule standard from next elections by stating a common agreement 
between students, representatives and professors. 

For the next elections, current representatives will actively look forward to:
recruit 1 representatives from each degree to implicitly obtain this rule 
until it's put in the Faculty rules.
