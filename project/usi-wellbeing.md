# USI Wellbeing

## Project

Increase the psicological wellbeing of usi students.
The purpose is to remove stressful situations 
and promote mental relieve in the daily life.

## Roadmap

### Academic year 2023/2024

**Reduce mailing list pollution** noise 
by asking the possibility to cluster students' associations mailing communication.

This feature might require an update in mailing system.
All communications could be clustered in a master monthly communication, 
classified and displayed per category. 
All this showcased in a pdf depliant/booklet style.

Not receiving more than 1 monthly general communication will decrease 
digital stress, organize mailing and cleanup inbox while increasing 
visibility of all associations and related events.

See [General Communication channel](#) for further discussion.

## Update

Academic year 2023/2024.
